                            We are the body. Christ is the head. The churches Online is an
                            extension of the body of Christ. It is a platform where believers
                            can connect to local churches as the body. Would you like a feature
                            on the Churches Online platform? It is a free service. Our main goal
                            is to promote unity in the body of Christ and operate as one body.

                                        The unity of the church is vital for our endurance. We&apos;re not
                                        meant to live the Christian life in isolation. And it&apos;s vital
                                        for our witness; Jesus authorized the unbelieving world to judge
                                        whether or not the Father sent Him into the world based on the
                                        church&apos;s visible unity (John 17:21). We seek out ways to
                                        unify the Church.

                                        The church, is the display of God&apos;s glory and wisdom (Ephesians 3:10),
                                        we must fight to maintain Christian unity (Ephesians 4:1-3).

                                        Simply put, the mission of the church is the Great Commission—what
                                        Philip Ryken calls “a clear, unambiguous statement of [the church's]
                                        mission to the world.” Our task as the gathered body of Christ is
                                        to make disciples, by bearing witness to Jesus Christ the Son in
                                        the power of the Holy Spirit to glory of God. Our mission is to
                                        connect believers to local churches.  

                                        The churches Online is a platform where believers can connect to local
                                        churches as an extension of the body of Christ.

                                        in the spirit realm. The scriptures say we have been crucified
                                        with Christ (Gal. 2:20). Not only did we die with Him on the
                                        cross at Calvary, we also have been raised with Him.

                                        even though the body is made up of widely different parts or
                                        "members." Each part of the body contributes to the overall
                                        functioning of that body. Paul says the same is true of the body
                                        of Christ. Each believer is one member of Christ's "body" on earth.
                                        Each of us is defined by the spiritual gifts given to us and the
                                        service they allow us to provide to the church.

                                    tempt and seduce the believer. The flesh sets its desire against
                                    the Spirit, and the Spirit against the flesh. To be led by the
                                    Spirit is the same as walking by Him (vv. 16, 25) but carries
                                    additional emphasis on His leadership.

                                    Jesus reveals to us that God is our Father, and that God is

                                    a human invention. There are signs of God’s existence and handiwork
                                    in creation for anyone to read (Acts 14.15–17). But we believe in
                                    the way we do because God has come to seek us out and has made
                                    himself known to us.
